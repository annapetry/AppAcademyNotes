          I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence.
